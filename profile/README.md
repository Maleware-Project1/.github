Introducing a novel concept in cybersecurity: the friendly malware! Contrary to traditional malicious software, this malware has a rather benevolent purpose. It encrypts only the .txt files within the current folder where it resides, ensuring that your data remains secure from unauthorized access. But here's the catch: decrypting your files is as simple as solving a game of Wordle!
