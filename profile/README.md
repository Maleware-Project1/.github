# Hi there üëã

Introducing a novel concept in cybersecurity: the friendly malware! Contrary to traditional malicious software, this malware has a rather benevolent purpose. It encrypts only the .txt files within the current folder where it resides, ensuring that your data remains secure from unauthorized access. But here's the catch: decrypting your files is as simple as solving a game of Wordle!

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è About Us

We are at the forefront of creating a revolutionary movie recommendation experience, blending cutting-edge technology with a deep passion for cinema. Our team is pioneering the development of a graph-based attention model to intuitively connect users with movies, ensuring every recommendation is a gateway to a new adventure.

## Features

- **Selective Encryption**: The friendly malware targets only .txt files within its current directory, ensuring that your textual data remains secure.
- **Decryption via Wordle**: Rather than demanding a ransom, decryption of encrypted files is tied to a Wordle challenge. Solve the puzzle, and your files are decrypted!
- **Server Interaction**: To facilitate decryption, the malware communicates with a remote server, where the symmetric key is securely stored.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Cryptography**: Fernet
- **Library**: sqlalchemy, nltk, rich
- **Backend**:  FastAPI, Docker
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
  
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker
### Installation

Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/advanced-movie-recommendation.git
cd advanced-movie-recommendation
python -m venv venv

To run the application:

python app.py

For Docker users:

docker-compose up --build

```

## Model Architecture
Our Graph-Based Attention Model (GBAM) intricately analyses user-movie interactions through:

- Graph Construction: Nodes are users and movies; edges are interactions.
- Feature Extraction: Embeddings for user and movie attributes.
- Attention Mechanism: Node and graph-level attention for relevance.
- Recommendation Engine: Combines embeddings to forecast preferences.
This architecture enables dynamic, personalized recommendations.

## Evaluation
We assess our model using:

- **Precision@K**: Accuracy of top-K recommendations.
- **Recall@K**: Coverage of relevant items in top-K recommendations.
- **NDCG**: Ranking quality, factoring the position of relevant items.
Continuous evaluation ensures the system's effectiveness.
